# Melanoma Detection Using CNN
Melanoma detection at early stage is crucial for treating the deadly cancer. Buidling a Model using CNN to predict the disease early.

# Problem Statement
Buidling a CNN Model to identfiy Melanoma at early stage using the skin images dataset published by The International Skin Imaging Collaboration(ISIC). 
# Model
Building CNN using Keras
# Augment the Dataset
Using Data Generators and Augmentors to reduce class imbalance in the dataset
# Validation
Training results and validations result are examined to reduce overfitting of model
